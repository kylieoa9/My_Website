However in more recent years, California has\nbecome known for its lack of rainfall leading to an excessively dry\nclimate and increase in wildfires. These dry conditions have been a\nresult of anthropogenic climate change that has been occuring around the\nglobe for many years (“Climate Science Special Report: Droughts, Floods,\nand Wildfire”).\nCalifornia’s wildfires have increased by 500% due to climate change\n(Meyer). Severity of wildfires are influenced by a number of different\nfactors including temperature, soil moisture, relative humidity, wind\nspeed, and vegetation (“Climate Science Special Report: Droughts,\nFloods, and Wildfire”).\nDrought has a major impact on the factors stated above. “Drought is a\ntemporary reduction in water availability below normal quantities\n(Lund).” Droughts can last for weeks, months, or even years. Drought is\ncategorized using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). This index\ntakes into account temperature and precipitation in order to estimate\nrelative dryness in a particular area (“Palmer Drought Severity Index\n(PDSI)”). This index ranges on a scale from -10, meaning very dry, and\n10, meaning very wet. If a region has an average index of below a zero,\nthen that region is considered to be in a drought.\n\nThe figure above shows the PDSI for California between 1933 and 2016.\nAs demonstrated by the figure, California has experienced several spans\nof droughts that have lasted multiple years each.\nBeing from California, I have experienced first hand the effects of\nthe 2012-2014 drought and have seen the significant impact it had on the\namount and duration of fires in California. So in this project, I wanted\nto research whether drought has an impact on fires in California. I\nhypothesize that there will be a relationship between the yearly\nseverity of the drought index and the total acres burned in California\neach year. I also hypothesize that California will have less overall\nprecipitation in the most recent decades due to climate change. I also\npredict there will be an increase in the severity of droughts and fires\nin more recent decades. These effects are also likely to show an\nincrease in annual dollar damage due to fires.\nI also plan to explore the number and severity of fires for years\nthat were reported as some of California’s most extreme droughts in\nhistory. These reports include the two-year drought between 1976-1977,\nthe six year drought between 1987-1992 and the three year drought\nbetween 2012 and 2014 (California’s Most Significant Droughts: Comparing\nHistorical and Recent Years).\n\n“California Drought Impact”\n\n\n\nMethods\nCalifornia drought data was gathered from the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) website. This data included the\ndrought severity index and the years the index covered between 1985 and\n2019. California wildfire data was collected from Github. This data\nincluded the yearly recordings of total number of fires, dollar damage,\nand acres burned between 1933 and 2016. California precipitation data\nalso was collected from Github. This data included total precipitation\n(in inches) for each month for the years between 1895 and 2017. Due to\nconstraints of the wildfire data, all analyses were conducted between\n1933 and 2016.\nI started by looking at various patterns including the total acres\nburned, average precipitation, and drought severity over time. I also\ncompared the differences between acres burned and drought index where\nthe drought index lagged between 0-7 years to see if drought has a\ndelayed impact on fire severity. I also looked at the average acres\nburned for each decade and compared it to average precipitation for that\ndecade. I conducted this analysis in order to see if average\nprecipitation or total acres burned has changed over the decades. I then\nsolely looked at precipitation for time periods where California\nexperienced its most severe droughts\n\n\nCalifornia Wildfires and Precipitation\nAs stated previously, California average severity of fires is at one\nof its highest points. This increase in severity of fires has been\nattributed to be a result of the global increase in temperature due to\nclimate change. This increase in temperature has also had an effect on\naverage precipitation, especially rainfall. Climate change is projected\nto increase rainfall in already wet areas but places such as California,\nwhich are already dry areas, will decrease in the amount of\nprecipitation (Clark).\n\nFigures A and B above show the total acres burned and the average\nprecipitation for each year between the 1933 and 2016 in California. The\ntotal acres burned was at an average low point between 1960 and 1990,\nbut since then there has been an overall increase in the severity of\nfires. Figure B shows the inverse effect of figure A. Average\nprecipitation was fairly stable and was at a high point between 1960 and\n2000, but there has been an overall decline in the average\nprecipitation.\nThis graph helps support the notion that there could be a\nrelationship between these two factors. This data is consistent with the\nprevious graph showing drought severity because drought severity seemed\nto increase overtime as well.\n\n\nIs There a Lag of Drought’s Effect on Wildfire?\nDrought has been known to be linked to the severity of wildfires.\nDroughts have a significant impact on not only the severity of wildfires\nbut also causes water shortages to forests, rural drinking water\nsupplies, and agriculture (Lund). These shortages in water have caused\nmass extinction of fish, killed millions of trees, and have caused the\neconomy to lose billions of dollars. Since droughts have such profound\neffects on environment and economy, it is important to see if droughts\nhave a lag of when they impact wildfires.\n\nThe figure above shows the total acres burned compared to the drought\nseverity index for each year with different lags ranging from zero and\nfive years. This graph shows that droughts only have an impact on the\nseverity of fires from zero to one year of lag, as shown by the slightly\nnegative correlation between drought severity and acres burned in the\nfirst two figures in the image above. There does not seem to be an\nimpact of droughts on acres burned between two to five years after the\ndrought occured.\nThis result suggests California takes about a year to be free of\nsignificant impact of droughts on wildfire severity. These results can\nhelp California be extra prepared for wildfires zero to one year after\nthe drought has occurred.\n\n\nCalifornia Drought, Precipitation, and Fires Over the Decades\nDue to an increase in climatic effects, it is important to see the\nchanges in environmental factors due to climate change over time.\nObserving the changes in these factors over the different decades can\nalso be used to understand patterns that can help to predict the future\neffects of climate change.\n\nThe figure above suggests that California has had on and off decades\nof being in and out of droughts. The worst dorughts that California\nexperienced were in the 30’s, 00’s, and 10’s. The graph also suggests\nthat California has, on average, experienced more droughts than not over\nthe past century. The only time California was not on average in a\ndrought was in the 40’s, 70’ and 80’s.\n\nAs shown above, the average acres burned has increased over the\ndecades. The 30’s and 40’s had the highest average acres burned within\nthe last century. This could be due to the drought in the 1930’s, that\nwas shown in the previous graph. There was a low in acres burned in the\n70’s and 80’s but there has been a steady increase since then. The graph\nalso does not include all of the data from the 2010’s because the data\nonly goes to 2016. So, this graph does not include major fires that\nhappened in 2018, which would probably skew the results if added.\n\nDollar damage, as a result of fires, has had a steady increase over\nthe decades. From the 30’s to 70’s, dollar damage of fires was at a low\npoint, however every year since then the dollar damage seems to\nincrease. This result is definitely partially due to the increase in\nacres burned in California. This result could also be this way because\nthere has been a 14% increase in the number of commercial buildings\nsince 2003 throughout the US (“U.S. Energy Information Administration -\nEIA - Independent Statistics and Analysis”). Since there has been such\nan increase in the amount of commercial buildings, it is practical to\nassume that there would be an increase in dollar damage. If there are\nmore buildings to be destroyed and there is an increase in the amount of\nacres a fire is affecting, then there would be an increase in the dollar\ndamage from fires in the US.\n\n\nCalifornia’s Most Severe Droughts: A Closer Look\nCalifornia has experienced some of its most severe droughts within\nthe past century. Some of California’s most notable droughts were\nbetween the years of 1976-1977, 1987-1992 and 2012-2014 (California’s\nMost Significant Droughts: Comparing Historical and Recent Years).\n\nThe 1976-1977 drought’s average precipitation and acres burned due to\nwildfire is demonstrated in the figure above with a two year buffer\nbefore and after the drought occurred. This drought caused significant\neffects to the ski industry by losing a lot of money due to insufficient\nprecipitation. National forests also had $10 million worth of trees die\ndue to the dry conditions that caused fires (Shelton).\nAs shown in the figure above, there is an inverse relationship\nbetween average precipitation and total acres burned during the drought.\nThere was an increase in fires between 1976 and 1977 and a major\nincrease in 1979. This is consistent with the average precipitation\ngraph. There was a decrease in precipitation in 1976 and 1977 and a\nlarge increase in 1978. There was once again a decrease in precipitation\nin 1979, which likely triggered the increase in acres burned.\n\nThe 1986-1992 drought’s average precipitation and acres burned due to\nwildfire is demonstrated in the figure above with a two year buffer\nbefore and after the drought occurred. Throughout this drought period,\nstreamflow had one-half of its yearly average (Nash). Precipitation also\nhad three-fourths of its yearly average. Average precipitation seemed to\nhave a similar inverse correlation to acres burned as the 1976-1977\ndrought.\n\nThe 2012-2014 drought’s average precipitation and acres burned due to\nwildfire is demonstrated in the figure above with a two year buffer\nbefore and after the drought occurred. This drought is the most severe\ndrought in 1,200 years. The drought was also thirty percent more severe\nthan the next worst drought which occured in 1580.\nThis graph does not show an inverse correlation between acres burned\nand average precipitation (Bora). The total acres burned in California\nincreased between 2010 and 2016, however precipitation fluctuated\ngreatly. While precipitation was low throughout the drought there was\nnot a decrease in the severity of fires after an increase in\nprecipitation. This effect could be because of the lasting effects of\nthe excessive dryness due to drought. Climate change could also impact\nother factors that contribute to high severity of wildfires and\ntherefore causing this high severity.\n\n\nDiscussion\nCalifornia is the most populous state and is a popular vacation spot\naround the globe. Due to changes in the climate, many California cities\nhave been destroyed due to fires. If climate change continues to\nprogress at this rate, cities will continue to be destroyed and there\nwill be an increase in the negative effects of droughts discussed\nbefore. This is particularly important because the last graph showed an\nincrease in severity of fire even after an increase in rainfall. This\neffect would only get worse if droughts, such as the 2012-2014 drought,\ncontinue to happen. The dollar damages due to fires will also continue\nto increase, causing a major hit for the economy.\nClimate change has not only had an impact on California, Australia\nhas recently experienced very severe forest fires and the entire globe\nhas been experiencing the effects of climate change through global\nwarming. Although the data used in this project does not capture the\neffects past 2016, these findings are still very pertinent today. In\n2018, a wildfire swept through Paradise, California killing 86 people\nand destroying total destruction of the city (Gee, Alastair, &\nAnguiano). Another notable fire was the Woolsey Fire, that occurred in\nVentura, which destroyed 97,000 acres, damaged more than 1,600 buildings\nand killed three people (Holland).\n\n“Paradise Fire Aftermath”\n\nParts of California, including San Francisco, received no rain in\nFebruary, 2020. This lack of precipitation has not happened since 1864\n(Leonard). California is predicted to enter another drought starting the\nsummer of 2020. California is also predicted to have an earlier\n“wildfire season” this year which means there will be an increase in the\nnumber of fires in 2020.\nAlthough this may not directly impact people who live outside of\nCalifornia, it indirectly has an impact on everyone. People should take\nnecessary steps, to be more environmentally friendly, in order to stop\nthe progression of climate change and to decrease the severity of\ndroughts and forest fires.\n\n\nReferences\nBora, Kukil. “California Drought Of 2012-2014 Is The Worst In 1,200\nYears: Study.” International Business Times, 6 Dec. 2014,\nwww.ibtimes.com/california-drought-2012-2014-worst-1200-years-study-1737522.\nCalifornia’s Most Significant Droughts: Comparing Historical and\nRecent Years.
