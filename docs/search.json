I obtained my B.S.\nin Neurscience at Union College, NY. At Union, I also minored in Data\nAnalytics and German. I am a current Ph.D. Candidate at UCLA in\nPsychology where I study older adults’ susceptibility to falling for\nscams and fraud. I recently interned at American AgCredit as their 2025\nData Science Intern. Upon graduation, I hope to pursue a career in Data\nScience so I can discover insights through data and code everyday! In my\nfree time, I love to explore National Parks, read books, and go to\nconcerts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
